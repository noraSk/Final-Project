# Final-Project
## Trivia Quiz Game

### Goals/Ideas
- The idea for this project is to create a quiz game by using only HTML,CSS and Javascript.
- Through this project I want to show that even with basic programming languages you can create a fun and easy game.
- I have already made a [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/pHXHCwf9WdaSbIJkVfSWUd/Trivia-Quiz-Game?node-id=0%3A1) on Figma on how I want the visual to look like.
- It also shows the basic layout of the questions.
- The Figma mockup is a rough idea hence the reason why the game turned out a bit differently.
- The inspiration came from the game "Who wants to be a millionaire", where you answer questions to obtain money.
- I want to make something similar to keep users entertained.
### Code Journal
- I started by making the first page, which introduces the title of the game and added the two buttons which I will be fixing with CSS later.
- Once you hit 'Play' you are taken to the second page, which are the categories.
- Based from the players knowledge, they get to choose the category of the questions that they want to answer.
- All the categories will have the same page layout just with different questions.
- Now that I have added all the pages layout for the categories, I'm thiking of adding the CSS, to get a better view on how it looks.
- It was easy to pick the colours because I just copied what I had chosen in Figma, same for the fonts.
- I added the javascript for all the categories, which also contain the questions and the correct answers.
- Fun fact, the answer changes to a green colour when you choose the correct answer and red when its incorrect.
- Now that I have added the high scores page too I want to fix the style a bit, it looks a bit plain.

### Failures
- If you have arrived at this section, congratulations! You are about to read some embarrasing failures which did not make it to this project.
- As I mentioned at the first section the mockup looks way more different than the final project because I wanted to base it on another game.
- Because that did not work out, I had to make a plan B.
- So, I went and did some research... and by research I mean play a few quiz games online to get a new idea.
- What was the problem? In the original idea I intended to put a money bar on the side of the questions.
- After multiple trys on Javascript, it didn't work for me. Some said to do it through ReactJs, I tried to but still didn't have enough time to learn more about ReactJs.
- I also did some research if it would work through CSS animation but I still ended up with nothing.
- Now back to plan B, most quiz games have the scores and the score bar.
- I found this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/zehad/pen/mdyejBB) that helped me with the score bar idea
- Also Tony shared [this](https://codepen.io/acidtone/pen/YbmvrX) idea if I changed my mind to do the money bar instead.
