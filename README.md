# Final-Project
## Trivia Quiz Game
### Goals/Ideas
- The idea for this project is to create a quiz game by using only HTML,CSS and Javascript.
- Through this project I want to show that even with basic programming languages you can create a fun and easy game.
- I have already made a [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/pHXHCwf9WdaSbIJkVfSWUd/Trivia-Quiz-Game?node-id=0%3A1) on Figma on how I want the visual to look like.
- It also shows the basic layout of the questions.
- The Figma mockup is a rough idea hence the reason why the game turned out a bit differently.
- The inspiration came from the game "Who wants to be a millionaire", where you answer questions to obtain money.
- I want to make something similar to keep users entertained.
### Code Journal
- I started by making the first page, which introduces the title of the game and added the two buttons which I will be fixing with CSS later.
- Once you hit 'Play' you are taken to the second page, which are the categories.
- Based from the players knowledge, they get to choose the category of the questions that they want to answer.
- All the categories will have the same page layout just with different questions.
- Now that I have added all the pages layout for the categories, I'm thiking of adding the CSS, to get a better view on how it looks.
- It was easy to pick the colours because I just copied what I had chosen in Figma, same for the fonts.
